Instead of simply leaving them scattered around the property, proper wheelie bin storage provides a dedicated space to contain, organize, and hide the bins. Proper wheelie bin storage can be anything from areas simply assigned for bin placement to constructible enclosures or screens for hiding your bins from view, while still allowing ease of access for you and for waste collection services.
