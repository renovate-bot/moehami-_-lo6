## People Also Asked About

### So, what is Goodwill Bins?

So, Goodwill bins— or what they like to call them, Goodwill Outlets— are these massive warehouse-type spots where all the stuff gets dumped into big blue bins instead of being neatly put on shelves like in regular stores. They sell everything by the pound, which means it's way cheaper than your typical Goodwill store. It's basically the final stop for items before they get shipped off to be recycled or salvaged.

How much does stuff cost at Goodwill bins?
So, pretty much at all Goodwill stores, they just charge you by weight instead of pricing each thing individually. Usually, clothes and fabrics are around $1.29 to $1.99 a pound, and stuff like housewares is around $0.69 to $1.49 a pound. And those fancy items—like electronics or furniture—have their own price tags, but they're usually awesome deals.

When's the best time to hit up Goodwill bins?
You gotta be an early bird at the bins! Most folks who are pros at bin shopping will tell you to show up right when the store opens or when they do those bin rotations every few hours. That is when they bring out the new stuff, so you've got the best chance of scoring some amazing deals.

## How to Find Goodwill Bins Near You

Well, finding your local Goodwill outlet is very easy, believe me! Just go to the official website of Goodwill and use their store locator—keep in mind looking for "Outlet" spots because they are different from the regular Goodwill stores. Or just type in Google Maps "Goodwill outlet near me" or "Goodwill bins near me".
