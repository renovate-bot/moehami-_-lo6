## Types of Bins Offered

Composting programs in New York City typically offer a few types of bins. Tumbler bins are ideal for tiny places and help the breakdown process. Traditional dumpsters are ideal for traditionalists who have enough space and time. Kitchen compost bins allow you to collect wastes in the kitchen before transporting them to your primary bin. Worm composting bins are perhaps the best choice for apartment residents. These compact indoor devices produce nutrient-rich compost quickly. Many New York City free compost bin programs feature worm bins designed for urban living.

## Making the Most of Your Compost

Composting is fundamentally about balance and patience. Remember that your bin should contain green materials—such as vegetable scraps or coffee grounds, which are rich in nitrogen—and brown materials—carbon-rich items like dry leaves or paper.

Keep the compost moist but not overly saturated; turn it occasionally to aerate the decomposition process. Meat, dairy products, oils, and pet waste should not be included in the bin, as these items can create significant disturbances and complications due to their presence.

Stay on the easier side at the beginning and learn composting gradually. Even a free compost bin NYC is pleased to provide requires some intention and improvisation for success. If your first batch was less than perfect, don't feel discouraged; one strengthens their composting skills through practice.

Obtaining a free compost bin NYC has to offer is only the start. The city has an array of resources for ongoing education, including online guides, video tutorials, and regular workshops. Composting classes will be hosted by numerous libraries, and community centers will have demonstration gardens to see composting in action.

Local gardening-related organizations and environmental groups also have new composter support networks. Such groups help with troubleshooting, share tips for urban composting difficulties, and sometimes put together bulk-ordering schemes for composting supplies!

## Composting Complete Q\&A Guide

## What are the materials that go into a compost bin?

In general, a compost bin is supposed to contain an equal balance of green and brown materials. Green materials are high in nitrogen: fresh kitchen scraps including vegetable peels, fruit scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, fresh grass clippings, et cetera. Brown materials, on the other hand, land on the rich carbon side of things: dry leaves, newspapers, cardboards, paper towels, dry plant materials.

Three parts of brown material should ideally go with one part of green material. The imbalanced condition will give microorganisms the wrong environment for their work in breaking down the matter. Water needs to be pared into the pile from time to time to keep it moist, never soggy.

## How to compost?

Making compost is pretty simple. First, choose a site for the compost pile that offers some sun and has drainage. Begin with a bottom layer made from coarse brown materials such as twigs or shredded cardboard, which will allow for good air circulation.

Next, layer green materials with their brown complimentary alternates, with each layer being approximately 4-6" thick. Water each layer so it feels damp to a wrung-out sponge. Turn the pile every two to four weeks after about a month to add oxygen that speeds decomposition. Depending on the conditions and maintenance, you can have fertilizer within three to twelve months. What should be added to the compost bin at the start? At the start of filling a compost bin, you gather green and brown materials. Start with dry brown materials, such as shredded newspaper, dry leaves, or small cardboard pieces, as the initial base layer. Then put in your green materials, which can be vegetable scraps, fruit peels, or coffee grounds. Throw in a shovel full of finished compost or garden soil to bring in microorganisms that will speed up the process of decomposition. In the absence of finished compost, do not panic, the process will still work, but just slower. Add water to make sure that moisture levels are adequate.

## What's' Not To Compost

Meat and fish scraps - Attracts pests and cause odor Dairy products - Become rancid and attract undesired animals Oils and fats - Decomposition slows while pests are encouraged Pet waste - Contains harmful bacteria and parasites Diseased plants - Spread plant disease through finished compost Weeds with seed - Seeds might survive and spread on application of compost Treated wood or sawdust - Might contain chemicals Coal or charcoal ash - Contains substances harmful to plants Glossy or coated paper - Contain chemicals that don't readily break down Synthetic materials - Plastics, metals and synthetic fabrics won't decompose Large branches - Too slow to break down without shredding Citrus peels in large quantities - Too acidic and might hamper decomposition Onions and garlic scraps - Might inhibit useful organisms in your compost pile

### To compost list: Green Materials (Nitrogen-rich):

Vegetable scraps and peels Fruit scraps and peels (less often) Coffee grounds and filters Tea bags with loose tea Fresh grass clippings Fresh plant trimmings Eggshells (crushed) Hair and nail clippings.

### Brown Materials (Carbon-rich):

Dry leaves, newspaper and plain paper, cardboard (shredded), paper towels and napkins, dryer lint (natural fibers only), wood chips and sawdust (untreated), straw and hay corn stalks and husks

## How to Compost at Home

Home composting can be set up in many ways. The conventional manner entails making a pile or using a bin somewhere in your yard. Layer the brown and green materials, keep the pile moist, and turn it regularly for aeration. For apartments and other small spaces, try vermicomposting (worm composting) using a special bin with red worms. Tumblers work well if you want faster results and easier turning. Kitchen scrap collectors allow you to collect materials before transferring them to a bigger system. Moisture: Like a wrung-out sponge. Airflow: Good air circulation. And be patient: It takes about 3–12 months, depending on your composting method, materials, and how well you maintain it. If you can, watch the temperature - active compost piles get hot when decomposing. What else belongs in your compost bin, other than on your list? From a typical household waste stream, the compost bin should receive vegetable and fruit scraps (except large amounts of citrus), coffee grounds and filters, tea bags, eggshells, yard waste such as leaves and grass clippings, paper towels, newspapers, and cardboard.

Including some dirt in the form of scraps from the kitchen will do most of the work of composting household waste. Save potato peels, carrot tops, apple cores, banana peels, and other produce scraps. Don't forget about coffee grounds-who knows, free grounds might even be offered by a café near you.

## What cannot be composted?

Certain items should never go into any compost bin. Animal products must be avoided at all costs: meat, fish, bones, dairy, and eggs (shells are OK). Avoid oils, fats, and any greasy foods. Because of their health risk, it is against the rules to compost pet waste or cat litter.

Diseased plants, seed-bearing weeds, and anything chemically treated should be avoided. Plastics, metals, and treated woods cannot be broken down and may leach harmful substances into the compost being made. Large objects that will not easily degrade should be avoided unless cut into smaller pieces.

## What do you throw in a compost bin?

Throw a balanced combination of organic matter in it. Daily additions may include vegetable peels left from cooking, coffee grounds scooped from the coffee pot in the morning, and fruit scraps from a snack. Throw in some used paper towels for cleaning purposes, so long as they're not contaminated, and chemicals, some newspaper, and cardboard packaging. From lawn maintenance, have you thrown in some grass clippings, fallen leaves, or plant trimmings? Seasonal additions could vary from disposing of jack-o-lanterns after Halloween through disposing of Christmas tree needles to laying down spring garden cleanup debris. Chop any big items into smaller chunks to hasten the decay process.

## What do you not put into a compost bin?

Never throwing in meat, fish, dairy products, and oils in a composting bin because these attract pests and cause terrible smells. On the other hand, avoid pet waste-soil has pathogens that are harmful. Skip diseased plants which could create further issues for your garden when you use the finished product. Don't add weeds gone to seed, as those seeds might survive the process and find their way to sprouting in your garden. Avoid anything chemically treated, such as pressure-treated lumber or a glossy magazine. If you have anything very large or slow in breaking down, chop it up or just leave it out. Synthetic materials such as plastic bags, metal, and glass obviously don't go into the compost. Even biodegradable plastics should be avoided because they might not break down completely under home composting conditions.
